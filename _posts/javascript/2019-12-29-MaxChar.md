## Max Char


Given a string, return the character that is most commonly used in a string

Example:<br>
maxChar('appcccccccle') = "c" <br>
maxChar('hello 11111111') = "1" <br>




~~~
function maxChar(str){
	const charMap = {};
	let max = 0;
	let maxChar = '';
	
	for(let char of str){
		if(charMap[char]){
			charMap[char] ++;
		}
		else {
			charMap[char] = 1;
		}
	}

	for (let char in charMap) {
		if(charMap[char] > max) {
			max = charMap[char]
			maxChar = char;
		}
	}
	return maxChar;
}

First we will use str param to fill the charMap object via looping
for (let char of str)
if charMap[char]++ will populate the charMap
else it will return 1;

Here is an example how it will look like:
Example "Hello World!"

{
	H:1,
	e:3,
	l:2,
	o:1,
	"":1,
	t:1,
	h:1,
	r:1,
	!:1

}
Hint: for of we use it for arrays and for in we use it for objects.
Then we use another loop to loop through charMap(object).
We create 2 temporary variables max = 0 and maxChar = '';
We loop through charMap and if values of charMap shown above in the example are greater than max 
( which is 0)
So max takes the value of the string with max value. Like in the example above first charMap[0] > max 
which it is it. H:1 1 > 0 so max will be reassign to 1. then goes to e > 1 yes max = 3 ....
At the end maxChar = char;
And we return maxChar;
