## isPrime

Prime Number is a number that can evenly divide by itself or one.

> ##For Example
console.log(isPrime(8)) false
console.log(isPrime(11)) true
console.log(isPrime(121)) false
console.log(isPrime(127)) true

function isPrime(num) {
  
  if (num < 2) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // modulus %
  for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

console.log(isPrime(8))
console.log(isPrime(11))
console.log(isPrime(121))
console.log(isPrime(127))

In order to solve the prime number checker we first create a function in our case *function isPrime(num)*
We know that prime numbers are numbers that are divisible by themself or by one so next logical step is who is our first prime number and that is number 2.
<br>
We create if statement checking *if(num < 2){ return false }* so if the number provided as a parameter is less than 2 is false since 1 is divisible only by 1.
<br>
Next in our journey we need the MODULUS operator, we create a function <br> 
*for(let i = 2; i < num; i++ ){
	if (num % i === 0) { 
		return false;
	}
}*
So we created a loop that goes from 2 to the one number less than the parameter and inside that loop we check if number divisible by the loop (2, 3, 4, 5, etc..) is equal to 0 than we return false<br>
Because if number is divisible by any loop counter and equal to 0 than that number is not prime that is why we return false.
<br>
In any other case we return true designated by *return true* after the for loop
