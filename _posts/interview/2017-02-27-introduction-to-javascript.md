## Programming in General

What is a program? Well it is piece of text you write in your editor as a programmer and directing to a functionality of what you what to become, direct, and provide.

> The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he [she] alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs. 
â€”Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason

That piece of text/code that you write goes to several steps which we will not discuss in this blog and it becomes a data in the computer's memory.

## JavaScript

One of the most used, popular and weird programming language.

The thought that I personally said it is weird it's not a problem it is an opportunity to learn this beautiful language and its features.

JavaScript first of all is nothing related to *JAVA*, and yes some of the syntax is similar to C#, Java and other programming languages, but JavaScript is nothing like them.

JavaScript is Dynamic Language: Which basically means that it executes at runtime

JavaScript is Compiled Language: It is not the same as the compilation like in C or Java but JavaScript Engine performs many of the same steps.

Like in most compiled languages a chunk of source code will go into several steps before executed.
[Also known as compilation]

The Compiler takes a chunk of code written by the programmer and break it down [Also known as tokenization],
then parse the code into a ATS [Abstract Syntax Tree], and at the end go through the process of Code Generation and turning that ATS into executable code.

We will not dig deep into Compiler and Engine but for the sake of understanding how the code written from a programmer works and which steps it takes this is how simply programing works. 

So how to learn this beautiful language?

In the words of the movie Dr. Strange

Ancient One: How did get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone?
Dr. Strange: Study and practice, years of it.

Enough of the movie references, but that is true. In order to learn you need to practice even the simplest of code.

## Why it is Important to learn

## Blog Overview

This blog will take into consideration that you already have beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS (we will not go deep into that but for the sake of some tutorials it is good to know).

There will be couple of sections which I believe to be fundamental for beginning then we will have some application to use all that we had covered since the application.

## Final Note

This Blog is called MEAN stack, named after its components MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js bear in mind that all of this components have JavaScript syntax. So the more you understand JavaScript the easier will be to master the full stack named MEAN.
