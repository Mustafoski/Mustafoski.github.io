## isPrime

Prime Number is a number that can evenly divide by itself or one.

> ##For Example
console.log(isPrime(8)) false
console.log(isPrime(11)) true
console.log(isPrime(121)) false
console.log(isPrime(127)) true

function isPrime(num) {
  
  if (num < 2) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // modulus %
  for (let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

console.log(isPrime(8))
console.log(isPrime(11))
console.log(isPrime(121))
console.log(isPrime(127))

First we create a function or also called method in this case fizzBuzz with a parameter of *n*. 
As the description above state if we have number divisble by 3 we console.log 'fizz' 
If we have number divisible by 5 we console.log 'buzz'
And if we have number that is divisible by 3 and 5 we console.log 'fizzbuzz';

We start with a loop in our case for loop, we initiate let i = 1; then for boolean expression we loop untill i is less or equal to the parameter *n*
And for the last piece of for loop we increment by 1;


Then we use several if and else if statements with the remainder operator to see witch number divisible by 5 or 3 or 5 and 3 is equal to 0;

1. if *i* is divisible by 15 ( which is the last number that is divisible by both 3 and 5) we console.log('fizzbuzz');
or should we say if 15 module 5 === 0 and 15 module 3 === 0 we get fizzbuzz

2. else if the number is only divisible by 3 we return 'fizz' 

3. else if the number is only divisible by 5 we return 'buzz'

4. and rest of the numbers used in else statement we return the number from the for loop in this case *i*
