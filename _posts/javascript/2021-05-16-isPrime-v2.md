## isPrime-v2

Prime Number is a number that can evenly divide by itself or one.

> ##For Example
console.log(isPrime(8)) false
console.log(isPrime(11)) true
console.log(isPrime(121)) false
console.log(isPrime(127)) true

function isPrime(num) {
  
  if (num < 2) {
    return false;
  }

  let root = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(num))

  console.log(root) // 3 , 4 , 11 , 12
  
  for (let i = 2; i <= root; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

console.log(isPrime(8))  Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(8)) => 3
console.log(isPrime(11)) Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(11)) => 4
console.log(isPrime(121)) Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(121)) => 11
console.log(isPrime(127)) Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(127)) => 12

In order to solve the prime number checker we first create a function in our case *function isPrime(num)*
We know that prime numbers are numbers that are divisible by themself or by one so next logical step is who is our first prime number and that is number 2.
<br>
We create if statement checking *if(num < 2){ return false }* so if the number provided as a parameter is less than 2 is false since 1 is divisible only by 1.
<br>
In order to divide our work and computation we use Math.sqrt which returns the square root of a number but in order to round it we use the Math.ceil function provided by javascript.

What is Math.ceil well MDN definition is The Math.ceil() function always rounds a number up to the next largest integer.
<br>
So we write the root in a variable then round it and take the square root of the number that is something like this *let root = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(num))*

<br>
Next in our journey we need the MODULUS operator, we create a function <br> 
*for(let i = 2; i <= root; i++ ){
  if (num % i === 0) { 
    return false;
  }
}*
So we created a loop that goes from 2 to the root number and inside that loop we check if number divisible by the loop (2, 3, 4, 5, etc..) is equal to 0 than we return false<br>
Because if number is divisible by any loop counter and equal to 0 than that number is not prime that is why we return false.
<br>
In any other case we return true designated by *return true* after the for loop
